## Installation Instructions
Okay Bloomer is a Full Stack web application using MongoDB, Express, Next.js, React.js (a.k.a MERN stack) along with Bulma CSS framework.  Follow these steps below to get this application up and running.
Before you continue, ensure you have installed the following software:
* Node.js
* npm
* MongoDB

**Clone the repository:**
``` ```

**Install Dependencies:**
```npm install```

**Configuring Enviornment Variables:**
Create a `.env` file at the root directory and include your enviornment variable like so:
```MONGO_URI=<Your MongoDB URI```

Replace `<Your MongoDB URI>` with the actual connection string to your MongoDB database.

**Running the Application**
Start the application in development mode:
```npm run dev```


## Blockers: 
Some blockers we faced include:
* Connecting components together.
* Developing a robust calendar handling system to schedule watering reminders and other plant care tasks accurately was new and challenging.
* Defining and validating prop types for each component to ensure that the correct data is passed down from parent to child components.

## Stretch Goals:
**Enhanced Task Management:** Improve upcoming tasks logic to handle multiple tasks for one plant. Implement functionality to edit, remove, and adjust task frequency per plant.

**Calendar Customization:** Enable the calendar to display multiple task types (such as pruning, potting, etc.) with differentiated markers. Tasks for a specific date should be displayed when the user hovers over it.

**User Notifications:** Implement a notification system to remind users of pending tasks. Notifications should respect the user's timezone for task deadlines.

**Plant Nicknames:** Provide the ability to edit the nickname of a plant on an individual user plant page.
Journal Entries Management: Enable users to edit and delete their journal entries.

**Enhanced User Interface:** Incorporate smoother CSS and animations, improving the loading status indicators and page transitions.

**Plant Sharing and Co-parenting:** Introduce a feature to share plants with friends, including a co-parenting option where additional users can receive task notifications.

**Custom Task Creation:** Allow users to create their own task types.
